# Flutter Firebase Chat App

## Overview

This Flutter Firebase Chat App is a real-time messaging application that allows users to send and receive messages instantly. The app is built using Flutter for the frontend and Firebase for the backend, providing a scalable and reliable solution for implementing chat functionality.

## Features

- Real-time messaging: Send and receive messages in real-time.
- User authentication: Authenticate users with Firebase authentication.
- Cloud Firestore: Store and sync data in real-time with Firebase Cloud Firestore.
- text messages: Support for text messages.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, make sure you have the following installed:

- Flutter: Follow the [official Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to install Flutter.
- Firebase: Set up a Firebase project and obtain the necessary credentials. Follow the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) to integrate Firebase with your Flutter app.

5. Run the app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
